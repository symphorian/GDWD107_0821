    <h1>Assignment 13 - Grids</h1>
    <p>This assignment is going to be a bit more free-form than our more recent ones.&nbsp; The objective is to show that you understand how to use CSS grids, and to show off your design skills.</p>
    <p>If you need a refresher on how to use Grids, take a look at the examples <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/symphorian/GDWD107_0821/blob/main/examples/Day15_grid_lineLayout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/symphorian/GDWD107_0821/blob/main/examples/Day15_grid_areaLayout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Instructions</strong></span></p>
    <p>Create a new file called Assignment13.html in your /assignments folder in your Portfolio repository.&nbsp; Complete the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your file must include a &lt;div&gt; (or other HTML element) that has display: grid.</li>
        <li>Your grid must have at least 5 columns defined.</li>
        <li>Your grid must be used to create a header, sidenav, content section, and footer (at the bare minimum.&nbsp; Feel free to go crazy adding other stuff into your grid)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An example of the bare minimum end result can be seen in the following image (try to do more than the bare minimum though; this is your time to show off!)</p>
