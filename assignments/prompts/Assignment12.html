    <h1>Assignment 12 - Mobile-first Layout with Flexbox</h1>
    <p>This is another "puzzle" type assignment. &nbsp;<span>You will be provided pre-written HTML and CSS, and your goal will be to write new CSS to change the page styles at the tablet and desktop breakpoints provided.</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Instructions</strong></span></p>
    <p>Download the attached Assignment12.html template, and put it in your Portfolio repository's /assignments folder.</p>
    <p><strong>DO NOT MODIFY THE EXISTING HTML AND CSS!</strong> You will only be <strong>ADDING</strong> new CSS in the media queries, pictured below.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/assignments/Assignment12/breakpoints.png" alt="breakpoints.png"  /></p>
    <p>When you first download the template, only the mobile version has been implemented (which is why this process is called "Mobile-first" design).&nbsp; It will look like the image below:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Task 1</strong></span></p>
    <p>Your goal is to write CSS that transforms the page when it hits the tablet breakpoint (between 480 and 800 pixels wide) so that it looks like the image below:</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/assignments/Assignment12/Tablet.png" alt="Tablet.png" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Task 2</strong></span></p>
    <p>Your next goal is to write CSS that transforms the page when it hits the desktop breakpoint (greater than 800 pixels wide) so that it looks like the image below:</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/assignments/Assignment12/Desktop.png" alt="Desktop.png" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Instructions</span></strong></span></p>
    <p>Submit the URL to your Portfolio website's Assignment12 page,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>not the GitHub.com code repository page</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>IF THERE'S ANY VISIBLE CODE ON THE PAGE YOU'RE SUBMITTING, YOU'RE SUBMITTING THE WRONG URL!</strong></p>
