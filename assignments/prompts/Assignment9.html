    <h1>Assignment 9 - Float and Clear</h1>
    <p>
      This assignment will be a little different from previous assignments; it's
      a little bit of a puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be provided pre-written HTML and CSS, and your goal will be to
      write new CSS to accomplish the 5 tasks in the assignment, but without
      changing the existing HTML or CSS.

    </p>
    <p>
      Download the attached Assignment9.html template, and put it into your
      Portfolio repository's /assignments folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not modify the existing HTML or CSS in the file; write your own CSS at
      the bottom of the internal stylesheet (after line 52).

      complete, each task in the assignment should look like the screenshots
      below.&nbsp; (If the screenshots don't load, visit the non-Canvas version
      of this assignment prompt <a href="#">here</a>).
