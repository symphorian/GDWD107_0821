  <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>1) HOW TO DESIGN A LEVEL (BASIC):</p>
  <p>To design a level, open up the blink_LevelEditor.swf file.  This<br />
    will open up the level editor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>1.a) Setting the level size</p>
  <p>First, you need to select how big you want the level to be by<br />
    setting the fields next to W and H. (Don't mess with the block<br />
    width and height, as I haven't really added the code to allow<br />
    different block sizes besides 200x200) Then click CREATE GRID.</p>
  <p>This will create a blank grid as a template for the level.<br />
  </p>
  <p>1.b) Tiling the level</p>
  <p>Click the &quot;Block Type Legend&quot; tab.  This will pull down the<br />
    available tiles you have to work with in designing the level.<br />
    Click on a block type to select it.</p>
  <p>I've only included a basic set of tiles, but ideally you'd be<br />
    able to create your own (see section ___ for info on importing<br />
    your own graphics)</p>
  <p>To color blocks, simply click on a block, or click and drag.<br />
    The blocks will change to the color you selected. Note that<br />
    the actual block tiles are more detailed than simple colors,<br />
    as you will see when you test out the level.<br />
  </p>
  <p>1.c) Exporting the level</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, because Flash is not allowed to write to files,<br />
    you have to do a bit of manual copy-and-pasting, but not too<br />
    much.</p>
  <p>Click on the &quot;Exported Level Code&quot; tab, and you will see the <br />
    scripts needed to create the level.  Click on the text, hit<br />
    Ctrl-A to select all of it, then hit Ctrl-C to copy it.</p>
  <p>Open up the LevelTest.txt file, and paste your code inside of <br />
    it and save it. (If there is already code inside, make sure to<br />
    get rid of it if you don't need it anymore)<br />
  </p>
  <p>1.d) Testing the level</p>
  <p>To test the level, simply open up the blink_LevelTester.swf file.<br />
    If you correctly exported the level code, you should be able to <br />
    test out the level you created.</p>
  <p>The character will move toward the mouse, and will jump when you <br />
  click.</p>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2) HOW TO DESIGN A LEVEL (ADVANCED):</p>
  <p>Although the basic steps from the previous section will allow you <br />
    to create a basic level, to allow the user more freedom, a more <br />
    extensive toolbar was added, as well as the &quot;Level of Depth&quot; and <br />
  the &quot;Imported Img Assets&quot; tabs.</p>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <p>*********************************************************************</p>
  <p>2.a) Using the &quot;Level of Depth&quot; tab</p>
  <p>The &quot;Level of Depth&quot; tab allows you to add depth to your level,<br />
    surprisingly enough.  In addition to the layer the character<br />
    interacts with, you can add an additional 10 layers of depth.</p>
  <p>To open up this part of the Level Editor, click on the tab <br />
    labeled &quot;Level of Depth&quot;.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.a.i) Layer Buttons</p>
  <p>The Layer Buttons are labeled from -1 to 9, with the smallest<br />
    number indicating the closest layer to the player and the largest<br />
    number indicating the farthest layer from the player.  Layer 0 is<br />
    marked with a little stick figure to indicate the layer that the<br />
    player's character moves on.</p>
  <p>By clicking a layer, you can either activate or deactivate it.</p>
  <p>- Activating a layer will cause a new, empty grid to be drawn at<br />
    the depth the layer exists at. </p>
  <p>- Deactivating a layer will cause the layer to be completely <br />
    erased, so be careful when clicking the Layer Buttons!<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.a.ii) Visibility Buttons</p>
  <p>The Visibility Buttons are the buttons under each Layer Button<br />
    with an eye inside of it.  These buttons allow you to make their<br />
    respective layers invisible or visible, without modifying the <br />
    layers contents. </p>
  <p>When the eye is slightly transparent, the layer will be invisible; <br />
    when the eye is solid, the layer will be visible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.a.iii) Lock Buttons</p>
  <p>The Lock Buttons are the buttons under each Layer Button with a <br />
    padlock inside of it.  These buttons allow you to lock a layer,<br />
    meaning the unused blocks in that layer will become hidden, and<br />
    you cannot interact with the blocks on that layer.</p>
  <p>When the lock is slightly transparent, the layer will be unlocked;<br />
    when the lock is solid, the layer will be locked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>********************************************************************</p>
  <p>2.b) Using the Toolbar</p>
  <p>The Toolbar can be found in the lower right corner of the Level<br />
    Editor.  There are 7 tools here, or 8 if you include the default<br />
    tool.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.i) Paint Tool</p>
  <p>This is the default tool when no other tools are selected. With <br />
    the Paint Tool, you can paint Blocks with whatever Block Type you<br />
    have currently selected. </p>
  <p>You can paint 1 block at a time, or you can click and drag over <br />
    several blocks to paint them all. </p>
  <p>By clicking on a Block already colored with the currently selected<br />
    Block Type, you can clear a Block so that it returns to its<br />
    colorless state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.ii) Grab Tool</p>
  <p>The Grab Tool is the first tool from the left on the Toolbar; it <br />
    contains a hand. You can activate the Grab Tool by clicking on its<br />
    button; doing so will cause the pointer to become the hand inside<br />
    the Grab Tool. You can deactivate the tool by clicking on the tool's<br />
    empty button; doing so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Grab Tool will allow you to grab the work area of the Level <br />
    Editor and pull it around as you wish.  This is useful if you<br />
    have zoomed in and want to view another area without zooming out.</p>
  <p>To use the Grab Tool after you've activated it, click anywhere<br />
    within the work area and simply drag it around until it is positioned <br />
    the way you want it to be.</p>
  <p>This tool does not affect the exported level code; it only applies a<br />
    superficial transformation to the work area.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.iii) Layer Shift Tool</p>
  <p>The Layer Shift Tool is found to the right of the Grab Tool.  You <br />
    can activate the Layer Shift Tool by clicking on its button; doing<br />
    so will cause the pointer to become the button's icon. You can <br />
    deactivate the tool by clicking on the tool's empty button; doing <br />
    so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Layer Shift Tool is used for testing out how the different layers<br />
    of depth will appear as you move around the level.  Once activated,<br />
    an outline representing the stage's viewing window will appear over <br />
    the work area. What you see through the stage outline represents<br />
    what you would see if the character were in that part of the level.</p>
  <p>Using the Layer Shift Tool is similar to using the Grab Tool; just <br />
    click and drag anywhere in the work area to see a fair approximation<br />
    of how the level will look as you move around it.</p>
  <p>Also like the Grab Tool, the changes made by this tool are purely<br />
    superficial; it will not affect the exported level code at all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.iv) Zoom In Tool</p>
  <p>The Zoom In Tool is the 3rd tool from the left with the magnifying<br />
    glass with the plus sign inside.  You can activate the Zoom In Tool<br />
    by clicking on it; doing so will cause the cursor to become the icon<br />
    within the button.  You can deactivate the tool by clicking on the tool's<br />
    empty button; doing so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Zoom In Tool is used, as you would probably expect, to zoom in on<br />
    a particular region in the work area.  Once the tool is activated, you<br />
    can click anywhere in the work area to magnify the blocks near where<br />
    you clicked.  This is useful if you created a large level and want to<br />
    work on a specific region in more detail.</p>
  <p>This tool does not affect the exported level code; it only applies a<br />
    superficial transformation to the work area.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.v) Zoom Out Tool</p>
  <p>The Zoom In Tool is the 4th tool from the left with the magnifying<br />
    glass with the minus sign inside.  You can activate the Zoom Out Tool<br />
    by clicking on it; doing so will cause the cursor to become the icon<br />
    within the button.  You can deactivate the tool by clicking on the tool's<br />
    empty button; doing so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Zoom Out Tool is used, as you would probably expect, to zoom out <br />
    from a particular region in the work area.  Once the tool is activated, <br />
    you can click anywhere in the work area to demagnify the blocks near where<br />
    you clicked.  This is useful if you created a large level and zoomed in to<br />
    work on a specific region in more detail, but now you want to step back<br />
    and view the level as a whole. There is a limit to how far you can zoom out.</p>
  <p>This tool does not affect the exported level code; it only applies a<br />
    superficial transformation to the work area.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.vi) Block Selection Tool</p>
  <p>The Block Selection Tool is the 3rd from the right in the Toolbar, with an<br />
    arrow over a block found inside. You can activate the Block Selection Tool<br />
    by clicking on it; doing so will cause the cursor to become the icon found<br />
    within the tool's button. You can deactivate the tool by clicking on the<br />
    tool's empty button; doing so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Block Selection Tool is used to select multiple blocks at once, in order<br />
    to apply changes to all of them at once. Selected Blocks are outlined in <br />
    white. The Block Selection Tool is similar to the Paint Tool; you can select <br />
    one Block at a time or click and drag to select multiple Blocks. Blocks will <br />
    stay selected even if you deactivate the Block Selection Tool.</p>
  <p>Likewise, you have two options to deselect blocks: You can click on a <br />
    selected Block to deselect it, or you can click an empty space in the work<br />
    area to deselect all currently selected Blocks.</p>
  <p>Selecting Blocks does not change the exported level code, at least on its<br />
    own; however, changes made to selected Blocks will modify the exported<br />
    level code.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.vii) Block Move Tool</p>
  <p>The Block Move Tool is the 2nd tool from the right in the Toolbar, with a <br />
    hand over a block found inside. You can activate the Block Move Tool by<br />
    clicking on it; doing so will cause the cursor to become the icon found<br />
    within the tool's button. You can deactivate the tool by clicking on the<br />
    tool's empty button; doing so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Block Move Tool is used to move Blocks from their original position to <br />
    somewhere else in the work area. Once the tool is activated you can move <br />
    individual Blocks, a selected group of Blocks, or an imported image (see<br />
    Section 2.c) by clicking on them and dragging them to the desired position.</p>
  <p>There is a restriction on the Block Move Tool: You cannot move a Block<br />
    outside of the dimensions you specified when you created the level. The <br />
    only exception is with imported images: only their centers are restricted<br />
    to the original dimensions of the level; the reason for this is to allow<br />
    more freedom to the user, so that they could potentially import images<br />
    larger than the original dimensions of the level. However, it is not<br />
    recommended to import excessively large images.</p>
  <p>This tool DOES modify the exported level code when you move Blocks around.<br />
  </p>
  <p>2.b.viii) Block Rotate Tool</p>
  <p>The Block Rotate Tool is the tool found on the right end of the Toolbar,<br />
    with a curved arrow inside it. You can activate the Block Rotate Tool by<br />
    clicking on it; doing so will cause the cursor to become the icon found<br />
    within the tool's button. You can deactivate the tool by clicking on the <br />
    tool's empty button; doing so will restore the cursor to its original icon.</p>
  <p>The Block Rotate Tool is used to rotate Blocks around their centers. Once <br />
    activated, you can rotate individual Blocks, a group of selected Blocks, or <br />
    an imported image (see section 2.c) by clicking on them and rotating them to <br />
    the desired orientation.</p>
  <p>A word of caution if you are rotating Blocks found on the layer that the <br />
    player's character interacts with: it is very difficult to get individual<br />
    Blocks to align once rotated.  So, if you intend to create an incline for<br />
    the player's character to walk up, it is recommended to select a group of<br />
    Blocks using the Block Move Tool and rotate the group, instead of rotating<br />
    blocks individually to form the hill (plus it save you a lot of time).</p>
  <p>This tool DOES Modify the exported level code when you rotate blocks.<br />
  </p>
  <p>**************************************************************************</p>
  <p>2.c) Using the &quot;Imported Img Assets&quot; tab</p>
  <p>The Imported Image Assets tab is where users find the external images they<br />
    wish to include in the game. <br />
  </p>
  <p>2.c.i) Including external images the in &quot;Imported Img Assets&quot; tab</p>
  <p>Including external images is a bit of a hassle, but once done, it does not<br />
    need to be done again.</p>
  <p>First, open up the ImageAssets.txt file.  If you want to include an image <br />
    in your level, it must be found here. One image should be included per line,<br />
    and should include the following arguments:</p>
  <p>IMAGE URL: the url that the image is found at. local urls are fine.</p>
  <p>CENTER COORDINATES: the center of the bounding box for this object, if the <br />
    upper left corner of the image is (0,0).  Note that this does not have to<br />
    be the actual center of the object (see example below)</p>
  <p>BOUNDING WIDTH AND HEIGHT: the width and height (in pixels) of the bounding<br />
    box with the CENTER COORDINATES above as the center.  Note that this does<br />
    not have to be the actual width and height of the object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Example 1: Normal image inclusion</p>
  <p>Suppose you have an image with dimensions 200x200 pixels and url grass.jpg.<br />
    To include this image such that the player's character will interact with<br />
    this image's bounding box exactly as it looks, the line would be:</p>
  <p>grass.jpg 100 100 200 200<br />
  </p>
  <p>Example 2: Image with smaller bounding box inclusion</p>
  <p>Suppose you have the same image, but when the player's character is on top<br />
    of the image, you want the character's feet to appear to sink into it a <br />
    little bit (in other words, you want bounding box to be a little smaller<br />
    so that the character doesn't actually collide with the object until it<br />
    is a certain distance into the object, say 50 pixels). To create such an<br />
    object, you would insert something like this:</p>
  <p>grass.jpg 100 125 200 150</p>
  <p>So the bounding box for grass.jpg is centered at (100,125), and the bounding<br />
    box extends 100 pixels to the left (to 0) and right (to 200), and also 75 <br />
    pixels up (to 50) and down (to 200).</p>

  <p>2.c.ii) Using imported external images in the Level Editor</p>
  <p>Assuming you correctly formatted the ImageAssets.txt file, when you open up<br />
    the blink_LevelEditor.swf file, you should be able to click the &quot;Imported<br />
    Img Assets&quot; tab, and see thumbnails of your images there, along with the <br />
    original size of the image and the size of the bounding box. (If not, check<br />
    the ImageAssets.txt file again and make sure each line follows the format as<br />
    explained in section 2.c.i: IMAGE_URL CENTER_X CENTER_Y BOUND_W BOUND_H )</p>
  <p>To use an imported image, just click on it, and, after a brief delay, it <br />
    will appear in the upper right corner of the top-most active layer. You can<br />
    now interact with it just like a normal Block: you can select it, you can <br />
    move it, and you can rotate it.</p>
  <p>Note that the image will appear in the top-most active layer at the actual<br />
    size of the image. Since raster graphics can become distorted when resized,<br />
    the blink Level Editor assume that you have already cropped the image to <br />
    the size you want it to be. Also realize that rotating a raster graphic <br />
    may cause similar distortions.  If you want an image to be rotated, it may<br />
    be wiser to modify it before importing it. (Helpful tip: bmp files can<br />
    include alpha (transparency) values, so if you want to rotate an image and<br />
    not see a bunch of white space, that may be one route you can take)<br />

  <p>3) Features in the Works</p>
  <p>This section will fill up as I get feedback. I have features that I myself<br />
    want to implement, but before putting them up, I want to see if other<br />
    people also want those type of features, or if I'm way off the mark.</p>
  <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
  <p>4) Conclusion</p>
  <p>That's it for now, but there should be a lot of modifications and additions<br />
    coming soon depending on the feedback that I get.  If you want to test out<br />
    future versions of the blink Game Engine, shoot me an email at:</p>
  <p>ryanreid2011@u.northwestern.edu</p>
  <p>and I'll make sure you get any updates I make.  Thanks for your help!</p>
