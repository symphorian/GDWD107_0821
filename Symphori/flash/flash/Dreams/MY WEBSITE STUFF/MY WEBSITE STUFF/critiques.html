    <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/" target="_blank">jodi.org</a></h2>
    <p>jodi.org is an interesting departure from what most of us would consider ‘good’ website.  While most of us expect a certain level of transparency in website content navigation, jodi.org deliberately ignores these preconceived notions, and rather than create a ‘website’, jodi.org creates a frontier in cyberspace for the user to explore.  This experience is very reminiscent (at least to me) of older text-based computer games. There are some obvious differences between the two, since the website utilizes computer graphics, and text-based computer games use text, but in both cases the sensation of being lost, with no direction and no assistance, seems to dominate the experience, at least at first.</p>  
    <p>As one traverses the space of jodi.org (space is a term that becomes very abstract here) and dives deeper into the site, there are no visual indicators or words that guide you from space to space.  The only real way to navigate is to move your pointer around and keep an eye out for when the pointer icon transforms to indicate clickable content (although more familiar-looking buttons can be found on certain levels of the site).  </p>
    <p>Of course, if you are more tech-savvy, you can use the source code of each page as a sort of roadmap through jodi.org; once you analyze the source code, you realize that most of the chaotic graphics are really just one or two gif images placed as the webpage’s background, and the location of the links that lead you to other pages becomes clearer.  However, sometimes taking a look at the source code is just as much an adventure as wandering through the site, as shown by the front page’s mysterious source code.  jodi.org aims to create an adventure for the user; you cannot traverse the site easily, and that is the whole point.  In an age when we expect to find information at the click of a mouse, jodi.org asks us to slow down, and re-experience the mystery and the unknown of cyberspace.</p>

    <a href="http://www.jimpunk.com/www/kasselpunk/" target="_blank">Samurai.remix</a></h2>
    <p>Warning! Samurai.remix is not for the faint of heart, or for virophobes (those with an intense fear of computer viruses).  Seriously.</p>
    <p>This piece really illuminates our current culture’s fear of computer viruses (or at least mine).  I do not think this was the main focus of the piece, but I’m sure the artist was aware of how people would react if they accidentally stumbled onto the site.  Personally, if more than one pop-up window appears, I start getting anxious; when they started appearing by the dozens in Samurai.remix, I really started freaking out.</p>
    <p>I think the real focus of the piece was to explore the use of the web browser as a dynamic medium, in a way that hadn’t been seen before.  Artists have put content into a web browser, but rarely does the web browser itself become part of the art piece, as in Samurai.remix.  The lack of control is rather terrifying at first, amplified by the first audio clip you hear: “All necessary modifications have been completed”; new windows pop up and move around the screen before closing, sci-fi sounds emerge and disappear in what seems to be a random score, and flashing pop-ups give you the option, “Click here to CRASH your computer”.  </p>
    <p>However, once you are brave enough to start clicking around, you discover that there are more layers to the site and more interesting things to view; one of my favorites was a window with “Pacman vs. Pikachu”.  The site is really quite intriguing once you realize that your computer isn’t succumbing to a virus, and also a technical marvel (I can’t fathom how to do anything so complex, nor even guess how long it took to create such a thing).  But, I don’t think I will ever find the strength to click the button to “Crash my computer”.  There is too much at stake if it really does so, which I think is another point the artist is trying to point out: just how much we value the content on our computers.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://128.111.69.4/~jevbratt/1_to_1/3/migration/" target="_blank"><img src="migrationScreenshot.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="'Migration'" /></a>
      <a href="http://128.111.69.4/~jevbratt/1_to_1/3/migration/" target="_blank">'Migration'</a></h2>
      <p>The concept behind 'Migration' is simple; look up all possible IP addresses on the web and categorize them by color.  While the concept is simple, the task is monumental: there are over 4,000,000,000 available IP addresses (assuming I did my math correctly), and you could easily spend your entire life looking them all up.  Of course, by the time you finished, the majority of them will have changed since the time you started looking, and your data will have become outdated.  </p>
    <p>And that fact emphasizes the whole point of the piece: the web is constantly changing, moving, migrating, and it is basically impossible to keep track of it all.  I was astounded to read that all the data that the artist, Lisa Jevbratt, collected only represented about 2% of the web's IP addresses, even when using "crawlers" to do the brunt of the data-mining automatically.</p>
      <p>Even more astounding to me is the large amount of empty space that is still not being used. This is not an unexplored frontier, or the 'edge of the map', so to speak.  This is space, created by us humans, that is not being used at all; it is completely empty.  It exists, but currently serves no purpose. Jevbratt's use of color emphasizes the emptiness of the piece; even with the millions of pixels of color, each representing a large chunk of data, there are millions more pixels without color at all, still an empty canvas.  Who knows if they will ever all be used?</p>
