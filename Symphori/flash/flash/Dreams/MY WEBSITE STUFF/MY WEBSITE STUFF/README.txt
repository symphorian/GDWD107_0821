RE: Little Red Riding Hood

OPENING THE SWF
You can simply load and play the swf directly off this disc.

However, if you want to play the swf from your computer, you will 
need to copy every file from this disc into a folder on your
computer.

The reason for this is that the swf dynamically loads the images
and the Actionscript files.  Therefore, the images and the files
that it needs to access must be in the same folder.


READING THE STACK COMIC
To cause the next panel to appear, you simply need to click the
swf.  Anywhere at all will do.


MISC
I don't recommend messing with the Chapter1.txt file.  It
contains the instructions for how to make the panels appear.  You
can fiddle with it if you like, but realize that you may cause the
swf to become unplayable.


TROUBLESHOOTING
If there are any problems when trying to play the swf file, please
